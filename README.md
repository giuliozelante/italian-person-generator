## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** (or higher)
- **Gradle** (included via wrapper)
- **GraalVM with Native Image** (for native compilation)

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/italian-person-generator.git
cd italian-person-generator

# Run with JVM
./gradlew run

# Build native executable
./gradlew nativeCompile

# The native executable will be in build/native/nativeCompile/

# Clean build
./gradlew clean
```

## üåç Multi-Platform CI/CD

This project includes GitHub Actions workflows for:

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every PR and push
- **Multi-Platform Releases**: Automatic building and releasing of native executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Creating a Release

To create a new release with native binaries:

1. Create and push a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build native executables for all platforms
   - Run tests and integration checks
   - Create a GitHub release with downloadable binaries
